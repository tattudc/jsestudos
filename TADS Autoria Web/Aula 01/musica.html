		<h1>Heart-Shaped Box</h1>
		<p>
		She eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak<br>
		I've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks<br>
		I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap<br>
		I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black
		</p>
		<p>
		Hey, wait! I've got a new complaint!<br>
		Forever in debt to your priceless advice<br>
		Hey, wait! I've got a new complaint!<br>
		Forever in debt to your priceless advice<br>
		Hey, wait! I've got a new complaint!<br>
		Forever in debt to your priceless advice<br>
		Your advice
		</p>
		<p>
		Meat-eating orchids forgive no one just yet<br>
		Cut myself on angel hair and baby's breath<br>
		Broken hymen of Your Highness, I'm left back<br>
		Throw down your umbilical noose, so I can climb right back
		</p>
		<p>
		Hey, wait! I've got a new complaint!<br>
		Forever in debt to your priceless advice<br>
		Hey, wait! I've got a new complaint!<br>
		Forever in debt to your priceless advice<br>
		Hey, wait! I've got a new complaint!<br>
		Forever in debt to your priceless advice<br>
		Your advice
		</p>
		<p>
		She eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak<br>
		I've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks<br>
		I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap<br>
		I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black
